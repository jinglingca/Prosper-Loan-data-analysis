Prosper is America’s first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with more than 2 million members and over $2,000,000,000 in funded loans. Here we use the data available to the public (last updated on March 11th, 2014) from Prosper, which contains all the listings and loans ever created with 81 variables on each loan/listing, to do some data analysis. As a potential amateur investor, I will explore the borrower market (including the demographic segmentation and beyond) and try to let data tell some ‘behind scene’ stories about the borrowers, also the performance of Prosper in terms of the volume of listings by year and by area.

I explored many kinds of data visualization throughout the analysis, including but not limited to bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts, histograms, box plots, pie charts, small multiples, correlation pair matrix, maps etc. It's fun!
